        <p> Little teen Arya Stark's great journey is to 
            acquire power to kill several people on her list, 
            ranging from kings to giants. A lost journey. 
            But Arya Stark makes a contract with Jaqen, a "sender" who teaches him how to kill, 
            who will give him the power to destroy all his enemies. At the same time, when Arya's journey of action is to kill her
             enemies, her inner journey is to settle the hatred she feels and that has thrown her into the revenge narrative.
