        <p class="blurb_one"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yes_(band)" target="_blank">Yes</a> was formed in 1968 in London 
            by singer <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jon_Anderson" target="_blank">Jon Anderson</a>, 
            bassist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Squire" target="_blank">Chris Squire</a>,
            guitarist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Banks" target="_blank">Peter Banks</a>, 
            keyboardist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Kaye" target="_blank">Tony Kaye</a>, 
            and drummer <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Bruford" target="_blank">Bill Bruford</a>.
            Through the years, the band has gone through numerous changes to include 19 different musicians.  The one
            constant was founding member Chris Squire until his death in 2015.  Without a question, the early 1970's
            marked the high point of their musical progressive rock production.

        <!-- A nice little quote on how the band was named -->
        <div class="quote">How the band was named:
        <q class="the_quote">Anderson suggested that they call the new band Life. Squire suggested that it be called World.
            Banks responded, simply, "yes", and that was how the band were named.</q>
