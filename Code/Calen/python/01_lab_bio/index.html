        The uniqueness of the i3
    </h1>
    <h2>
        The bmw I3 is a b segment high roof hatchback 
        manufactured and marketed by BMW with a traditional 
        single motor rear wheel drive electric motor 
        and a two speed transmission. This was BMW's first ever
        zero emissions vehicle producted for mass market outside
        of concept vehicles like the MINI cooper E that would later
        come into production in late 2020.

    <h3>
        The journey of the i3:
        <ol>
            <li>Due to how niche the i3 is in the market, all i3s can be made in a single plant! all are manufactured in the Leipzig plant.</li>
            <li>After that they are shipped by dealer order to the destination country via a large cargo boat, protected by large amounts of wrap and degradable coverings</li>
            <li>
                for i3s like mine, they are often picked up in places like california and hauled via truck to the selling dealer. 
            </li>
            <li>
                the final destination is the first (or second) owner to take it home and use.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <br>

            For the BMW i3, everything is intentional from the wheels on up.'
