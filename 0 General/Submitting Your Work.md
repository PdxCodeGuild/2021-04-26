# Submitting Your Work

## Pushing to GitHub

The first step to submitting your work is to push your code to GitHub. In your terminal navigate to your lab folder, make sure you are on your branch `git branch --show-current` and execute the following commands.

1. `git pull`
2. `git add lab_name.py` (replace lab_name with the name of your solution.)
3. `git commit -m "added lab_name solution"`
4. `git push`
5. You should be able to see your commit in GitHub under your branch.
