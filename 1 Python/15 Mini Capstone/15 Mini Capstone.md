# Mini Capstone

For your final Python project, build a program that solves a problem or accomplishes a task. The functionality of the program is up to you -- use this as an opportunity to get creative. Sometimes students explore an idea they want to use for their capstone project or solve an actual problem they have.

Having trouble thinking of an idea? Try using a third party python library. For a list of Python libraries to consider using in this project, check out [https://awesome-python.com](https://awesome-python.com/)

Want to use an API? Here is a large list of public APIs. [https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis](https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis). Keep in mind some of these APIs do require you to create an account with them, and some may even require payment to use. Generally if it says no in the `Auth` and `CORS` column you should be good to go.

# Presentation

At the end of the Python and Django sections, you'll give a presentation on a "mini-capstone" assignment. This is practice for your capstone presentation which you'll give on the last day of class.

These presentations help you practice communicating technical topics in English. Being able to speak intelligently about programming is almost as important as programming itself. This skill will allow you to better talk to interviewers, managers, clients, coworkers, and more.

In all three presentations, you should first explain the development process and the different parts of your code. Then run the application and show its features and interaction (entering data, seeing results, etc). Here are some questions to contemplate while planning out your presentation:

what problem does your application solve? what is the core function it performs?
how did you go about planning?
what major issues did you encounter during the course of development? how did you go about overcoming them?
how did your vision for the project change over time?
what part did you like the most? least?
what is the future of the project? what features (if any) will you work on next?
